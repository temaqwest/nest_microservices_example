# NestJS microservices IPR

First you have to install all dependencies separately for all services like this: 

* `cd ./api-gateway`
  * `npm install`


* `cd ./user-service`
  * `npm install`


* `cd ./module-service`
    * `npm install`

After this you can run all services and api-gateway using `npm run start:dev` in all three directories
